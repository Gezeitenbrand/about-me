# Helloooo GitHub

I come from a Microsoft 365 background and I'm a learning enthusiast trying to wrap my head around lo- and no code development, aka the Power Platform

Unfortunately I'm a non-IT-guy, trapped in an IT world, which means that I will ask any kind of stupid questions to evolve into something more IT-ish 🤷‍♂️ And that's why I'm pretty hyped about the idea behind GitHub and #SharingIsCaring

# Level 50 stuff

I will start using GitHub to publish articles on Power Platform Level 50 content. Wait, there is no Level 50 content in the Tech world, right? Right, but there should be. And I will just explain why this is needed to include everybody and empower people to use awesome tech #diversity and #inclusion

# I blog

Everything else I usually publish on my blog www.gezeitenbrand.de, which I use as a learning diary to write blogs about tech stuff I just learned. 
Any kind of pictures and graphics you will find there are made by myself. You know, I'm kind of an artist myself 🎨😁

# Diversity and Inclusion
Maybe it's because of my non IT backgrund or the fact that I raise two girls, but I do think that diversity and inclusion are a thing we should talk about more often, especially in IT. I started recognizing some issues while talking to a bunch of (female) friends but in the end it is about so much more. Everyone of us is unique in their own special way and that leads to so many creative and wild solutions. I strongly believe, that everyone can benefit, if we include everybody. I want people to be able to contribute and express their ideas.
But, I will need your help 😛
